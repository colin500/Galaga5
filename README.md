# Galaga5

[A working version of where I am in development](http://hoorayimhelping.github.com/Galaga5/)

This is a clone of the arcade classic Galaga done in HTML5. The game engine and logic is written in JavaScript and rendered using HTML5's cavans tag and a 2d rendering context.

## About

I'm writing this because I've always wanted to make a video game, and I figured I'd start with a clone. I chose Galaga because my ex really enjoyed it as a kid and it seemed like a good way to impress her.
