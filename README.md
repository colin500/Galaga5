# Galaga5

[A working version of where I am in development](http://hoorayimhelping.github.com/Galaga5/)

This is a clone of the arcade classic Galaga done in HTML5. The game engine and logic is written in JavaScript and rendered using HTML5's cavans tag and a 2d rendering context.

## About

I'm writing this because I've always wanted to make a video game, and I figured I'd start with a clone. I chose Galaga because my it's girlfriend's favorite arcade game (until I met her, I wouldn't have known it was possible to have a girlfriend with a favorite arcade game) and I wanted to impress her.
