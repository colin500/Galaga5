I'm writing this because I've always wanted to make a video game, and I figured I'd start with a clone. I chose Galaga because my it's girlfriend's favorite arcade game (until I met her, I wouldn't have known it was possible to have a girlfriend with a favorite arcade game) and I wanted to impress her.
